                <div class="fs-18 fw-5">What are some common photography types?</div>
                Popular photography genres include landscape, portraits and people, street, travel, aerial, weddings and events, sports, wildlife, macro, and more.<br><br>
                • Landscape photographs show the outdoors. Generally, they capture nature, but often include man-made features – even entire cityscapes. The most common lens for landscape photography is a wide angle, but telephoto lenses are a wonderful way to isolate and highlight specific features of the scene. For more, check out our Landscape Photography page.<br><br>
                • Portraits and people photography ranges from capturing family outing all the way to full-time professionals working with in-studio models. For portraits, a short-to-moderate telephoto lens (such as a 105mm) is preferred by many due to pleasing compression and rendering of facial features.

                • Street photography is candid photography made in public situations. It generally intends to capture life, culture, and humanity, and does not necessarily require the presence of a street or an urban environment. Small and unobtrusive is the way to go here, camera-wise. For more, check out Eight Recommended Digital Cameras for Street Photography.<br><br>
                • Travel photography involves capturing the essence of far-off places. A small and light kit that can handle anything from landscapes, food, people, and street is ideal. · Aerial photography is any photograph taken from the air. Whether it’s from a sightseeing helicopter, the window seat of an airplane, or from a camera drone, this is a surefire way to get a new perspective on things. For more, check out our <a href="#">Drones page</a>. <br><br>
                • Weddings and events can often be stressful and hectic. Having backups of your gear is essential, as there is often no chance to get a second chance if something goes wrong. For more, check out our <a href="#">Wedding Photography page</a><br><br>
                • Sports can be taking pictures of Junior’s soccer match, shooting from the sidelines of an NFL game, and anything in between. Lenses for sports can range from an all-in-one zoom for a few hundred dollars, to a this-lens-is-more-expensive-than-my-car supertelephoto. For more, check out our Sports Photography page.<br><br>
                • Wildlife shares many of the challenges and gear requirements of shooting sports – in both cases you are trying to capture fast-moving subjects that are at some distance. A gimbal head on your tripod can be invaluable here, especially when shooting birds in flight.
